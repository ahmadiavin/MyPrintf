This project is a simple reimplementation of the `printf()` C standard library function. 

## Description
This is a command-line application that handles the following conversion specifiers:
(character, string, signed integer, unsigned integer, octal, hexadecimal, memory address) based on their associated flags in the C language (`%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%u`, `%o`, `%x`, `%p`)
